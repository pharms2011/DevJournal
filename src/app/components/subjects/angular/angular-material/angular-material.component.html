    <h2>What is Angular Material?</h2>

    <h2>Principles</h2>
    <p>
      1: Material is a metaphor<br/><br/>
      Material design handles elements as if they are 3 dimensions, just like material in the real world. This means using
      things like shadow to give this illusion.<br/><br/>
      2: Bold,graphic, and Intentional<br/><br/>
      Color pallets and typography is chosen intentionally to create an environment.
      3: Motion provides meaning<br/><br/>
      Animations in material are used to convey what is happening on the page and in the application. this is used rather
      than jarring motions.<br/><br/>
