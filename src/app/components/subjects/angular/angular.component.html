    <h2>What is Angular?</h2>
    <p>
      Angular is a modern TypeScipt framework, which is focused on creating reactive single page applications.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Typscript</h2>
    <p>
      Typescript is a superset of Javascript that is much more similar to Java or any other object oriented language. Type
      script is transpiled when the angular app is built into vanilla javascript which runs much more easily in the browser.
    </p>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p>
      Angular Components are standalone page elements that make up our angular application. When generating a Component,
      Angular will generate the Typscript, HTML, and CSS files as well as a file used for testing. The main core of
      Angualar is the modularity of Components that help to divide complexity down and to reuse code as much as possible.
      We signify that a typescript file is a component with the @Component decorator imported from Angular core. Within the
      decorator you supply the component with metadata including the name of the selector by which the component is
      referred to later in the application, the templateUrl or location of the HTML file, and the stylesheet used for
      specific styling of the component. You can also define all of the CSS and HTML in the typescript file. You can also
      set your component to be set by attribute by placing your selector in square brackets or tho=rough class declaration
       by using .selector-name as the selector of the component..
    </p>
    <h2>App Module</h2>
    <p>
      The app module is the code component of a module that houses the functionality of an app. The app.module file will
      include all of the imports used throughout the module. It also registers all of the internal aspects including
      components and services created for the application.
    </p>
    <h2>Databinding</h2>
    <p>
      Databinding is connecting data in the front end to data stored in the application logis. This can be accomplished
      using String Interpolation or Property Binding.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>String Interpolation</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
      This is the simplest form, connecting a string value in the backend to connect to a simple string element in the front end.
      Anything put into the curly braces must resolve to a string, this means it can be a method or a string variable or
      even just a string.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="code">
      {{'{'}}{{'{'}}"data"{{'}'}}{{'}'}}
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Property Binding</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Property binding allows you to link a value in the backend to dynamically set the property of an HTML element. This
      value can be any data type corresponding with the property. You can also bind to directives and other components.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="code">
      {{'['}}property{{']'}}=value
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Event Binding</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Event binding allows a direct correlation between events on the DOM to functions and logic in the backend. Functions
      can be created in the backend, typically using onEvent naming convention. This allows a connection between the DOM
      and user input.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p class="code">
      Ex:
      <br/><br/>
      HTML:
      <br/><br/>
      (Within an HTML tag)(click)="onCreateServer()
      <br/><br/>
      Typescript:
      <br/><br/>
      onCreateServer(){{'{'}}

      {{'}'}}
    </p>
    <h2>Animations</h2>
    <p>
      Animations in Angular can be a bit unpredictable, but are basically assigned to an HTML decorator in the HTML tag.
      They can be added and specified from the ts file withing the metadata for teh component. These can also be tied to
      specific values of an assigned variable in
    </p>
    <p class="code">
      Ex:
      <br/><br/>
      trigger('balloonEffect', [<br/><br/>
      state('initial', style({{'{'}}<br/><br/>
      backgroundColor: 'green',<br/><br/>
      transform: 'scale(1)'<br/><br/>
      })),<br/><br/>
      state('final', style({{'{'}}<br/><br/>
      backgroundColor: 'red',<br/><br/>
      transform: 'scale(1.5)'<br/><br/>
      })),<br/><br/>
      transition('final=>initial', animate('1000ms')),<br/><br/>
      transition('initial=>final', animate('1500ms'))<br/><br/>
      ]),<br/><br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Karma Testing</h2>
    <p>
      Karma tests are included implicitly with every generated component and service in Angular within the spec file.
      These files are used as templates to test primarily your typescript files and your applications business logic.
      Specifically for angular, testing helps a lot when there is an update and you would like to pin point where your
      code no longer works.<br/><br/>
      Tests are designed to simulate a user in your application to make sure it works in the way you are expecting. The
      tests typically include the testing module from angular core which includes TestBed and async. Most test start with
      before each and before each asyc functions to help set up the appropriate variables and settings for each test. The
      tests also contains a test to determine if the app was created. <br/><br/>
      Karma tests use expect as forms of assert statements. You must also render elements on your own with functions like
      fixture.detectChanges() as these will not be rendered by default.
     <br/><br/>
      Ex:
      <br/><br/>
    </p>
    <p class="code">

    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>Routing Testing Issue</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>
      I had some issues at one point getting an exception creating a navigation component that used the routing module.
      I resolved this by among other things adding the import to the imports array in the components spec file.
